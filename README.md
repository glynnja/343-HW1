Some commands that will be commonly used:
git init 
git status
git add filename.txt
git commit -m "message about what was commited"
git.add '*.txt' 
git log
git remote add origin https://github
git push -u 
git pull 
git diff HEAD
get diff --staged
git reset filename
git checkout -- filename
git branch branchname
get rm '*.txt'
git merge branchname
git branch -d branchname

Most of these commands allow one to add or delete a file. To save a file to a repository you'll first have to stage the file and then commit it to the repository. You can then see the differences between each commit using the diff command.
